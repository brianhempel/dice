# Secure Random Dice Roller

A small little online app for when you need to trust that your dice are fair.

Try it out: https://brianhempel.github.io/dice/

The app uses [window.crypto.getRandomValues()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RandomSource/getRandomValues)
to ensure high quality randomness.

Overkill for just rolling some dice? Nah... ;)
